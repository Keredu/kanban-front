## Contributions
### Main branches
This project has two permanent branches:

- main: it is the main branch of the project and it is where the latest productive version is saved.
- dev: this branch serves to integrate all the features or fixes that occur during development.

### Contribute
If you want to contribute to the project, you must create a new branch as follows:

1. Move to the dev branch with the `git checkout dev` command.
2. Update said branch with the latest changes with `git pull`.
3. Check that the dev branch is updated, then use `git checkout -b <branch_name>`.
4. The following standard will be used for the branch name:
    - If the branch adds a new **feature** the branch name will be feature/name.
    - If the branch applies a **fix** the branch name will be fix/name.

To integrate the changes, you must make a pull-request pointing to the dev branch and assign it to another developer to validate that these changes are correct.
